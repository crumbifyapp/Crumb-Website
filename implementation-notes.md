# Implementation notes — site-handoff rebuild (Tasks 1-4)

Scope covered in this pass: Task 1 (layout part - fonts/metadata), Task 2 (landing.css +
static sections), Task 3 (client islands - Header, ScrollFX, HeroMap/Hero), Task 4
(FoundingSection redesign). Tasks 5-7 (referral system, deletions, e2e rewrite) are NOT
part of this pass and remain open.

## Deviations from the plan (conservative choices, logged per finding-unknowns.md)

1. **CSS scoping**: `landing.css` selectors are all scoped under a `.landing` root class
   (`.landing .hero`, `.landing .btn`, etc.) rather than bare global selectors as in the
   source HTML. Reason: `globals.css` (Tailwind) still ships site-wide for the legal/admin
   pages per CLAUDE.md ("Tailwind globals.css stays for legal/admin pages; landing.css is
   additive"). Bare `body`, `a`, `h1` etc. selectors from the handoff source would leak into
   every other route. `page.tsx` wraps all sections in `<div className="landing">`. Values,
   tokens, spacing, and breakpoints are otherwise byte-for-byte identical to the source.

2. **`--disp`/`--body` font wiring**: `landing.css` sets `--disp:var(--font-disp),"Bricolage
   Grotesque",sans-serif` (chaining the next/font CSS var with a literal fallback) rather
   than overwriting the token outright, so the font tokens degrade gracefully if the
   next/font variable is ever unavailable (e.g. a future storybook/isolated render).

3. **Bricolage Grotesque font config**: `next/font/google` requires `weight: "variable"`
   when an `axes` array (opsz) is supplied - a fixed weight array combined with `axes`
   throws a Turbopack resolve error ("Axes can only be defined for variable fonts...").
   Switched to `weight: "variable"` to get the full opsz 12..96 + full weight range in one
   variable-font file, matching the source's Google Fonts URL
   (`Bricolage+Grotesque:opsz,wght@12..96,400..800`) semantics exactly.

4. **`leaflet` `tap` option**: `@types/leaflet`'s `MapOptions` doesn't declare `tap` (a real
   Leaflet.Map runtime option used to work around mobile tap-delay). Passed via an inline
   `...({ tap: false } as object)` spread with a comment, rather than widening the whole
   `L.map()` call to `any`, to keep the rest of the call type-checked.

5. **Commit granularity slip**: the HeroMap island and Hero section assembly landed in a
   single commit (`feat(landing): leaflet hero map island`) instead of two, because the
   second `git commit` in that batch found nothing staged (my `git add -A` covered both
   files in the first commit). Everything after this point in the sequence was committed
   individually as intended. Noted here per the house granularity rule rather than silently
   passing.

6. **Metadata `themeColor`**: kept `themeColor` inside the `Metadata` export (matches the
   plan's phrasing "update metadata... theme-color #F4ECE1"). Next.js 16 emits a
   non-fatal build warning recommending a separate `viewport` export instead; this matches
   the pre-existing pattern already used by every other page in the app (`privacy`,
   `terms`, `support`, etc.), so left as-is for consistency rather than introducing a new
   pattern on this page alone. Flagging as a candidate for a repo-wide `viewport.ts` sweep
   in a later pass.

7. **`FoundingSection` id**: confirmed `id="founding"` on the `<section>` per the
   coordinator's requirement (the parallel Task 5/6 e2e rewrite targets `#founding`).

## Automation-as-infrastructure question

What recurring class did this work expose, and what automation now guards it?

The class: hand-porting a static HTML/CSS/JS reference file into React risks silent
copy/value drift (a wrong hex, a missed keyframe, a renamed class) that's invisible until a
pixel-diff review. The guard shipped in this pass: `data.test.ts` locks `scoreColor`'s exact
output at the boundary values (0, 10, clamping, string coercion) that the whole visual
system (map pucks, feed score badges, taste-match card) depends on — if a future edit
changes the HSL formula, the test fails immediately rather than surfacing as an off-color
puck a human has to spot. The page-composition smoke test (`page.test.tsx`) guards the
second common failure mode for this class of work: a section silently failing to render
(missing import, thrown effect, hook order violation) that a pure visual pixel-diff might
not catch in CI. Neither guard replaces the side-by-side visual QA against
`Crumbify.html` called for in Task 7 (not yet run — that task is out of this pass's scope).

## Gate results (this pass)

- `npx tsc --noEmit`: clean for all files touched in this pass. Remaining errors belong to
  `waitlist-extended.test.ts` and `EtherealShadow*.test.tsx` — both pre-existing, both
  targeted for deletion in the plan's Task 6 (old waitlist capture + old ui component this
  session did not touch).
- `npm run build`: succeeds (Turbopack, all 17 routes compiled/prerendered).
- `npm test`: 334 passed / 60 failed, 18 suites passed / 12 failed. All failing suites are
  pre-existing (`waitlist.test.ts`, `waitlist-extended.test.ts`,
  `EtherealShadow.test.tsx`, `EtherealShadow-extended.test.tsx`, plus duplicate copies of
  the same files jest picked up from `.claude/worktrees/*` scratch checkouts) and are
  unrelated to this pass's changes - not fixed here per the task's explicit "report, don't
  fix" instruction for pre-existing failures. The two new landing test files
  (`data.test.ts`, `page.test.tsx`) pass, 7/7 tests.

## Commits (this pass, chronological)

1. `feat(layout): swap to Bricolage Grotesque + Hanken Grotesk fonts, handoff metadata, remove preloader/smoothscroll`
2. `feat(landing): port handoff css tokens + base styles`
3. `feat(landing): data arrays + scoreColor + store svgs`
4. `feat(landing): atoms (cookie, puck, store badges)`
5. `feat(landing): manifesto + how-it-works`
6. `feat(landing): feed marquee cards`
7. `feat(landing): band + taste match + groups`
8. `feat(landing): cta + footer`
9. `feat(landing): header + mobile drawer island`
10. `feat(landing): scroll fx island (lenis, reveals, parallax)`
11. `feat(landing): leaflet hero map island` (includes Hero.tsx assembly — see deviation 5)
12. `feat(landing): founding section redesigned in handoff language`
13. `feat(landing): compose page sections`
14. `test(landing): scoreColor unit tests + page composition smoke test`

Plus a follow-up fixup commit for the `tap` type error and Bricolage `weight: "variable"`
fix, folded into the layout/HeroMap commits above via amendment-free new commits — see
`git log` on this branch for exact SHAs.

## Not done in this pass (explicitly out of scope per the task brief)

- Task 5: referral redirect route, Supabase migration, admin dashboard.
- Task 6: deletion of old landing components/hooks/api routes, `/ref` + `/invite`
  redirects, stale test cleanup (this is what's causing the pre-existing test failures
  above), e2e rewrite.
- Task 7: side-by-side visual QA against `Crumbify.html`, CLAUDE.md/HANDOFF.md/memory
  updates, PR.

Old `src/components/landing/*` files (ConnectorLine, CrumbParticles, DiscoverCard,
EmailCapture, FeaturePhoneA, GroupCard, LedgeButton, PersonalityChart, PhoneFrame,
ReviewCard, SoulmateCard, tokens.ts) were left in place untouched, per the brief's
instruction not to delete old files (a later cleanup pass does that). They are no longer
imported from `page.tsx` or the new `FoundingSection.tsx`.

## Pixel-fix F-53 fix-round r2 (website repo)

Round-2 re-review (wave1-rereview-r2.json) closed 9/10 round-1 findings and
opened 5 new ones (F53-N1..N5), all in this repo. Fixed all five:

- **F53-N1 (HIGH):** round-1's fix for F53-R1 (self-styling StoreBadges,
  deleting `.landing .store`/`.stores` CSS) silently regressed the
  MARKETING HOMEPAGE - `landing.css` is imported UNLAYERED at
  `src/app/page.tsx` while Tailwind's utilities live inside
  `@layer utilities` (`src/app/globals.css`'s `@import "tailwindcss"`), so
  unlayered `.landing a{color:var(--gold-2)}` / `.landing a:hover{color:
  var(--ink)}` always beat the plain `text-white`/`hover:text-white`
  utilities regardless of specificity - badge labels rendered gold, and
  near-invisible ink-on-black on hover. Fixed by switching to Tailwind v4's
  `!` important modifier (`!text-white hover:!text-white`) on the anchor,
  which emits `!important` and wins over any unlayered non-`!important`
  rule too. Also restored the two orphaned layout rules the class deletion
  broke: `StoreBadges` now takes an optional `className` prop (CTA.tsx
  passes `justify-center` to recentre the badges in its centred `.cta-in`
  band) and carries its own mobile-responsive Tailwind utilities
  (`max-sm:gap-[10px]` on the wrapper, `max-sm:flex-1 max-sm:min-w-0
  max-sm:justify-center` on each anchor) replacing the dead
  `max-width:560px` `.landing .stores`/`.store` rules, which are now
  removed from `landing.css` with a pointer comment. Verified the ONLY
  consumers are `Hero.tsx`, `CTA.tsx`, `ProfileShareLanding.tsx` (all still
  correctly render via the shared component, just with the colour now
  robust to the cascade and the CTA band's centring restored via prop
  rather than a global class hook).
- **F53-N2 (LOW):** `ProfileShareLanding.tsx` rendered the give-up
  fallback CTA in the server-rendered HTML on every platform (`isAndroid`
  is `false` during SSR - no `navigator`), so an Android recipient's FIRST
  PAINT was "get the app" before flipping to "Opening in the Crumbify
  app..." post-hydration. Added a second `useSyncExternalStore`
  (`isHydrated`, same SSR-false/client-true shape as the existing
  `isAndroid` read) gating BOTH the opening-message and fallback-CTA
  branches, so the page shows only the neutral `@username` heading until
  hydration is known to have happened. jsdom's `render()` is a client-only
  mount (not a real SSR->hydrate pass) so it can't reproduce the flash
  behaviourally - added a static-analysis regression test instead,
  asserting the `isHydrated` gate is wired onto both branches by source
  inspection, per the repo's static-analysis-test convention (mirrors the
  app repo's `.claude/rules/testing-and-gates.md` pattern).
- **F53-N3 (LOW):** the App Store badge's visible label read "Download on
  the App Store" even when `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_STORE_URL` was unset (href
  `/#founding`), disagreeing with its own aria-label and the Play badge's
  already-conditional convention. Mirrored the Play badge: `smallLabel`
  is now `appStoreUrl ? "Download on the" : "Coming soon"`.
- **F53-N4:** app-repo-only, see `../worktrees/pixelfix-share-f53/implementation-notes.md`.
- **F53-N5 (LOW):** removed the non-spec `comment` key from
  `assetlinks.json`'s statement object (restoring the plain two-key
  `relation`/`target` shape a Digital Asset Links verifier expects) and
  moved the owner-action note to a new `public/.well-known/README.md`.

Automation-as-infrastructure check: the recurring class here is exactly
the one this repo's `.claude/rules/ultracode-workflows.md` and the app
repo's `implementation-playbook.md` already name - "a fix round introduces
its own regression" (specifically: deleting CSS coupled to a component
without checking what ELSE that CSS's selectors were carrying, and without
checking the unlayered-vs-layered cascade interaction with Tailwind v4).
No new automated guard added for the cascade-order class specifically
(a genuine Playwright/computed-style check was flagged as the ideal fix by
the r2 reviewer but is out of scope for a targeted fix round - jsdom
cannot compute real CSS cascade); logged explicitly per the Standing Test
rather than silently skipped. The `!important` fix itself is a structural
guard against a repeat of this exact regression (an `!important` utility
cannot lose to an unlayered non-`!important` rule, so a future landing.css
edit can't silently re-break this again the same way).

Gates run this round: `npx tsc --noEmit` -> 0 errors. `npx eslint` on all
touched source + test files -> 0 errors (1 pre-existing unrelated warning
on CTA.tsx's `<img>` usage, not touched by this fix). Targeted jest
(`--testPathPattern "(StoreBadges|ProfileShareLanding)"`, `--maxWorkers=2`)
-> 2 suites / 25 tests passed (7 new tests added: App Store fallback
label, className merge x2, 4 F53-N2 static-invariant assertions). Full
`npm test`, `npm run build`, `next build` NOT re-run in this fix-round
session (targeted-only per this session's scope, and this repo's known
pre-existing failing suites - `waitlist-extended.test.ts`,
`EtherealShadow*.test.tsx` - are unrelated and out of scope, see the
earlier "Gate results" section above).

## Round 3 re-review fixes (F53-R3-1, F53-R3-2, F53-R3-3) - 2026-08-06

**F53-R3-1 (MED):** the r2 fix for F53-N1 (homepage gold-on-black labels / near-invisible
ink-on-black hover) added no test asserting the anchor's colour utility - only the `!`
(important) modifier stands between the homepage and the regression recurring, and jsdom
cannot see the compiled cascade outcome directly. Added a test in `StoreBadges.test.tsx`
asserting both badge anchors carry `!text-white`/`hover:!text-white` (or the v4 trailing-`!`
spelling). Verified fail-capable: manually stripped the `!` locally and confirmed the new
test goes red (then restored it) before committing.

**F53-R3-2 (LOW):** the mobile CSS the r2 fix ported used Tailwind's default `max-sm:`
(640px) and `flex-1` (`flex:1 1 0%`), not the ORIGINAL deleted rule's `@media(max-width:560px)`
and `flex:1 1 auto`. Changed both anchor and wrapper to the arbitrary-variant
`max-[560px]:` breakpoint and `flex-[1_1_auto]`, matching the deleted CSS exactly on two of
its three axes. The THIRD axis is an accepted deviation, documented in the component header:
the old rules were `.landing`-scoped and never reached `/u/[username]`, but these Tailwind
utilities live on the anchor itself and apply everywhere `StoreBadges` mounts - so
`ProfileShareLanding`'s badges now also get the mobile stretch/gap behaviour the homepage
always had. Judged harmless/positive rather than worth chasing (would require a second,
`.landing`-scoped copy of the utility, reintroducing exactly the coupling R1 removed).

**F53-R3-3 (LOW):** `showFallbackCta` was gated on `isHydrated`, which made the
SERVER-RENDERED HTML content-empty on every platform (a no-JS visitor got only the
"@username" heading - no store badges, no explanation), and delayed the correct first paint
on iOS/desktop until after hydration. Dropped the `isHydrated &&` conjunct from
`showFallbackCta` (now the plain `!showOpeningMessage`) - `showOpeningMessage` keeps its
`isHydrated` gate untouched. Verified this does NOT reintroduce the F53-N2 hydration
mismatch: React renders the false server snapshots (`getServerIsHydratedSnapshot`,
`getServerIsAndroidSnapshot`) during BOTH the actual server render and the client's
hydration-matching render, so server HTML === hydration HTML regardless of this branch; the
subsequent re-render (once `useSyncExternalStore` re-reads the live snapshots) is an ordinary
post-hydration update, not a mismatch. No `<noscript>`/`suppressHydrationWarning` needed.
Updated the four F53-N2 static-invariant tests in `ProfileShareLanding.test.tsx` to the new
`showFallbackCta = !showOpeningMessage;` shape (was asserting the now-removed
`isHydrated && !showOpeningMessage`), and added an assertion that
`getServerIsAndroidSnapshot` still returns false (the fact that makes the no-mismatch
argument hold).

**Automation-as-infrastructure answer:** F53-R3-1's new test IS the automation this class was
missing - a `!`-drop or Tailwind-version codemod now fails the suite instead of shipping
silently. F53-R3-2/F53-R3-3 are behavioural corrections with their existing static-invariant/
render-test coverage updated to the new intended shape; no new guard class was needed beyond
that.

Gates run in this worktree: `npx jest` (full suite) = 16 suites / 154 tests PASS (was 152
before this round; +2 net: F53-R3-1's new colour test, +1 net across the F53-N2 rename/
additions in ProfileShareLanding.test.tsx). `npx tsc --noEmit` = 0 errors. `next build` /
Playwright e2e NOT re-run in this scoped fix pass.

## Round 4 re-review fixes (R4-WEB-1, R4-WEB-2) - 2026-08-06

**R4-WEB-1 (LOW):** the F53-R3-1 colour guard added to `StoreBadges.test.tsx` used unanchored
regexes (`/!text-white|text-white!/`, `/hover:!text-white|hover:text-white!/`), so the BASE
assertion still matched the `!text-white` substring inside the surviving `hover:!text-white`
token even with the base utility's own `!` removed - only the hover half was genuinely
guarded. Anchored both regexes on whitespace/string boundaries
(`/(^|\s)(!text-white|text-white!)(\s|$)/` and the `hover:` equivalent) so the base and hover
utilities are each independently guarded. Re-verified fail-capability by stripping ONLY the
base `!` from `StoreBadges.tsx` (leaving `hover:!text-white` intact) and confirming the test
goes red, then restored the source (no diff left in `StoreBadges.tsx`).

**R4-WEB-2 (LOW):** F53-R3-3's `showFallbackCta = !showOpeningMessage` (see round-3 entry
above) reopens F53-N2 (r2, LOW) - on a genuine Android device the fallback CTA now paints
briefly pre-hydration before swapping to the "Opening in the Crumbify app..." message, the
exact flash F53-N2 originally fixed. `ProfileShareLanding.tsx`'s header (lines ~24-38 before
this round) asserted the opposite ("no flash of the give-up state on Android"), and neither
the header nor these notes had previously named the reopened finding.

ORCHESTRATOR DECISION (round 4): KEEP the F53-R3-3 behaviour - do NOT restore the
`isHydrated` gate on `showFallbackCta`. Rationale: a content-empty SSR/no-JS dead end (r2's
shape, hit by every no-JS visitor and by iOS/desktop's first paint) is judged strictly worse
than a brief pre-hydration flash of the fallback CTA on Android only (r3's shape). This is an
ACCEPTED DEVIATION from F53-N2's original fix, not a bug and not an oversight.

What changed this round (docs-only, no behavioural change from F53-R3-3):
- `ProfileShareLanding.tsx`'s file header rewritten to describe the actual behaviour and name
  the deliberate trade explicitly, citing F53-N2 vs F53-R3-3 by id.
- The inline comment immediately above `const showFallbackCta = !showOpeningMessage;` now
  states plainly that Android sees a flash and that this is accepted, pointing back to the
  header and this section.
- `ProfileShareLanding.test.tsx`'s F53-N2 static-invariant test for `showFallbackCta` gained a
  comment documenting that its locked shape is INTENTIONAL - reads the opposite way as a "bug"
  to a future agent who has not read this section, so the risk of someone "fixing" it back to
  `isHydrated && !showOpeningMessage` (silently re-regressing F53-R3-3's no-JS/first-paint fix)
  is called out explicitly in the test file itself, not only here.

No test assertions were changed in a way that alters pass/fail behaviour for R4-WEB-2 (comments
only) or for R4-WEB-1 beyond genuinely tightening the guard. Gates re-run: `npx tsc --noEmit` =
0 errors; `npx jest` (full suite) = 16 suites / 154 tests PASS (unchanged count - no tests
added or removed this round, only regex/comment edits).

## Wave-3 fix round 1 (W3R1-share-f53b-01, -03, -06) - 2026-08-06

App-repo-adjudicated review findings that also touch this repo. Full detail
(including the app-side findings 02/04/05) lives in the app repo's
`implementation-notes.md` "Pixel-fix F-53b, fix round 1" section - this
entry covers only the website-repo half.

- **W3R1-share-f53b-01 (MED)**: added `docs/deeplinks/universal-link-
  prefixes.json`, a verbatim duplicate of the app repo's new canonical
  manifest of the same name (each names the other as its "twin" in its own
  header comment). New `src/__tests__/well-known/universal-link-prefix-
  manifest-parity.test.ts` checks `public/.well-known/apple-app-site-
  association`'s `components` array against THIS repo's manifest copy in
  both directions, replacing the previous hardcoded-expectation-list guard
  (`apple-app-site-association.test.ts`, left in place unchanged - it still
  covers the shape/appID/wildcard invariants this new file does not
  duplicate). See the app repo's implementation-notes.md for the full
  "why this is REAL parity now, not two independent lists" writeup and the
  explicit limits of what it does NOT automate (no cross-repo diff - the
  two repos run in separate CI checkouts).

- **W3R1-share-f53b-03 (MED)**: added `src/__tests__/components/share-
  landing/attempt-app-deep-link.test.ts` - direct unit tests for
  `buildCrumbifyDeepLink(pathSegment, id)` (previously only exercised
  indirectly via a `jest.mock()` in `AppShareLanding.test.tsx`): the three
  real path-segment shapes, percent-encoding, underscore/hyphen round-trip,
  the empty-id edge case, and a smoke test for `attemptCrumbifyDeepLink`'s
  `window.location.href` assignment. Mirrors the profile-share sibling's
  own test file shape-for-shape.

- **W3R1-share-f53b-06 (LOW)**: no code change in this repo - the Android
  rollout-ordering note belongs to the app repo (its intent filters are
  what require a native build). This repo's AASA update takes effect on
  the website deploy alone with no equivalent gap. See the app repo's
  PR-DESCRIPTION-NOTES section for the exact wording to carry into both
  PRs' descriptions.

Gates run this round: `npx tsc --noEmit` = 0 errors. Targeted jest
(`--testPathPattern "(universal-link-prefix-manifest-parity|share-landing.
attempt-app-deep-link)"`, `--maxWorkers=2`) = 2 suites / 13 tests PASS.
## B6c website admin moderation - 2026-09-13

- Implemented `/admin/moderation` with a page-level `requireAdmin()` gate. The existing ungated admin layout remains unchanged so sign-in and callback routes stay reachable.
- Reports, active bans, and audit history use the B6a RPC names and render independent unavailable states. Report status actions and unban actions validate their form inputs, re-check admin access, revalidate the page, and redirect with generic result codes.
- Moderation RPCs use the server-only Supabase service-role key with the verified admin bearer in the `Authorization` header. This keeps the B6a `auth.uid()` guard and audit actor correct. GoTrue unban uses a separate bearer-free service-role client only after a bearer-aware `is_platform_admin` RPC returns exact `true`, then records `admin_unban` with the verified bearer.
- `POST /api/admin/session` now requires an exact allowlisted Origin, or an exact allowlisted Referer origin when Origin is absent. Missing, malformed, null, and lookalike origins receive 403 before JSON parsing or cookie writes.
- Unauthorized access remains fail-closed with the existing redirect. Navigation never auto-bans an account.

## B6c review-to-zero security correction - 2026-09-14

- Recurring class: privilege escalation through a bearer-free admin client. `unbanModerationUser` now calls `is_platform_admin` through the bearer-aware RPC client and requires `data === true` with no error before it creates or calls GoTrue. It then calls `admin_unban` with the same verified bearer client after GoTrue succeeds. The exact ordering and denial-before-GoTrue contract are guarded by `src/__tests__/lib/admin/moderation.test.ts`.
- Recurring class: duplicated boundary validation drifting between service and actions. `isModerationUuid`, `isReportSource`, and `isReportStatus` are exported from `src/lib/admin/moderation.ts`; actions consume those guards. The guard contract is covered in `moderation.test.ts`, and action invalid-input tests cover fail-closed redirects.
- Recurring class: environment-specific origin allowlists accidentally permitting localhost in production. `POST /api/admin/session` allows only `https://crumbify.co.uk` in production and allows localhost only outside production. `src/__tests__/api/admin-session.test.ts` covers development localhost, production localhost rejection for both Origin and Referer, exact-origin checks, Referer fallback, and rejection before JSON parsing/cookie writes.
- Recurring class: unrequested security notification paths adding secrets and failure modes. Removed `sendUnauthorizedModerationAlert`, all Resend adapters and environment requirements, and all page/action alert calls and tests. Unauthorized page and action tests continue to prove the existing redirect.
- Required production-file headers were added to `moderation.ts`, moderation `actions.ts`, moderation `page.tsx`, and the admin-session route. These headers state purpose, security/brand rules, interfaces, and that test IDs are none for server-only files.
- Focused GREEN gate: `npm test -- --runTestsByPath src/__tests__/lib/admin/moderation.test.ts src/__tests__/app/admin-moderation-actions.test.ts src/__tests__/app/admin-moderation-page.test.tsx src/__tests__/api/admin-session.test.ts --maxWorkers=2` -> 4 suites / 56 tests passed.
- Full browser exit check remains incomplete and requires an owner-authenticated live moderation flow. No alert environment variables are required.
- Review round 1: the action test now loads the real exported guards with `jest.requireActual` instead of reimplementing UUID/source/status rules. The moderation test adds false, truthy non-boolean, null, RPC-error, and rejected-RPC preflight cases, each asserting denial before GoTrue and `admin_unban`. Covering command: `npm test -- --runTestsByPath src/__tests__/lib/admin/moderation.test.ts src/__tests__/app/admin-moderation-actions.test.ts src/__tests__/app/admin-moderation-page.test.tsx src/__tests__/api/admin-session.test.ts --maxWorkers=2` -> 4 suites / 61 tests passed.
- Review round 2: the rejected `is_platform_admin` RPC case explicitly asserts that `admin_unban` is not called, in addition to no GoTrue client creation. `npm test -- --runTestsByPath src/__tests__/lib/admin/moderation.test.ts --maxWorkers=2` -> 1 suite / 26 tests passed.
- Final whole-branch fix wave: report reads now always call `admin_list_reports` with `p_status: 'queued'`, `p_limit: 50`, and a validated `p_before` timestamp or `null`. The page exposes Older reports only for a full page and Newest reports for an older cursor, and renders only allowlisted result/error messages. RED covered missing exact params, missing cursor propagation/navigation, and absent status messages. GREEN command: `npm test -- --runTestsByPath src/__tests__/lib/admin/moderation.test.ts src/__tests__/app/admin-moderation-actions.test.ts src/__tests__/app/admin-moderation-page.test.tsx src/__tests__/api/admin-session.test.ts --maxWorkers=2` -> 4 suites / 71 tests passed; full Jest -> 33 suites / 417 tests passed.
- Final review fix round 2: the page now uses an own-key lookup for result/error message codes, so prototype names such as `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `toString` render no banner and do not crash. Report pagination is outside the non-empty branch, so an older cursor page with zero or unavailable reports still has a Newest reports escape link; explicit tests also prove initial empty and unavailable pages have no pagination. Page gate: 1 suite / 17 tests passed.

## B6c review-to-zero fix round (PR #21, second pass) - 2026-09-14

Nine findings, all fixed on `codex/admin-moderation`.

- Recurring class: mixing service-role credentials into a bearer-scoped RPC client. `createServiceRoleRpcClient` was renamed `createVerifiedRpcClient` and now authenticates with `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (every moderation RPC is `GRANT`ed to `authenticated`, verified against `supabase/migrations/370_moderation_rpcs.sql`), keeping `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` confined to the GoTrue admin client only. Guard: `moderation.test.ts`'s "production moderation client wiring" describe now asserts the RPC client never receives the service-role key and the GoTrue client never receives the anon key.
- Recurring class: RPC/GoTrue failures logged nowhere. Added `logModerationServerError(operation, error)`, exported from `moderation.ts`, called from every read (`readModerationRows`) and write (`admin_set_report_status`, `is_platform_admin`, `auth.admin.updateUserById`, `admin_unban`) failure path, and from `page.tsx`'s top-level `fetchModerationData` catch. It logs only the operation name plus a Postgres/Auth error `code`/`status`, never the error message (which can echo user emails) and never a token. Guard: three new tests in `moderation.test.ts`'s "server-side error logging" describe assert the logged object shape and assert `JSON.stringify(consoleErrorSpy.mock.calls)` never contains the seeded secret message or the access token.
- Recurring class: an unban that clears the GoTrue ban before the audit-writing RPC runs can leave the account unbanned with zero audit trail if that RPC fails. `unbanModerationUser` now re-applies the hard ban (`876000h`, matching the app repo's `admin-moderate` edge function `HARD_BAN_DURATION`) as a best-effort compensating action when `admin_unban` fails after GoTrue succeeds, then throws the new exported `ModerationUnbanPartialError` (never masked by a re-ban failure). `actions.ts` maps that error to a distinct `unban_partial` redirect code; the page renders distinct copy naming the missing audit entry. Guard: three tests cover the happy compensation path (exact duration asserted), a re-ban that itself errors, and a re-ban that itself rejects - all still throw the distinct error.
- Recurring class (automation-as-infrastructure): `admin-routes-gated.test.ts` only walked `page.tsx`/`route.ts`, so a `'use server'` actions file could add a payload-reading statement before its `requireAdmin()` call with zero coverage. The walker now also picks up `actions.ts` files containing `'use server'`, and for those files runs a stronger check (`checkServerActionsGating`) requiring `requireAdmin()` to be the FIRST statement of every exported async function, not merely present somewhere in the file. New RED fixtures (`checkServerActionsGating (the actions.ts guard itself)` describe) prove the guard actually flags a non-compliant export by name, prove a compliant one passes, and prove both real actions files (`admin/moderation/actions.ts`, `admin/referrals/actions.ts`) already gate correctly today - `admin/referrals/actions.ts` was already conformant, no fix was needed there.
- Recurring class: the report page size (`p_limit: 50`) was duplicated as an independent literal in the service and the page. Exported `REPORT_PAGE_SIZE` from `moderation.ts`; the page imports it instead of declaring its own copy.
- Recurring class: silent, undocumented caps. `admin_audit_log` relied on the RPC's own server-side default of 100 rows with no `p_limit` argument at all. Added `AUDIT_HISTORY_LIMIT = 100`, now passed explicitly as `p_limit`, and the page renders "Showing the latest 100 entries." driven by the same constant.
- Recurring class: a loose `Date.parse`-based cursor guard accepted shapes Postgres `timestamptz` does not parse the same way ("1", "2026", "Dec 25"). `isModerationCursor` now requires the exact `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ` shape `toISOString()` produces, via a regex, before the `Date.parse` sanity check. Guard: tests assert all three brief-cited bad inputs are rejected even though `Date.parse` alone accepts them, plus near-miss ISO variants (no milliseconds, offset instead of `Z`, date-only).
- Added a report status filter (`?status=queued|actioned|dismissed|all`, default `queued`) validated by the new exported `isReportStatusFilter` guard, mapped to `p_status` (`null` for `all`). The page renders three plain links to the other three statuses (never a link to the currently active one) and preserves the filter across the Newest/Older pagination links.
- `POST /api/admin/session` rejected every Vercel preview deploy with 403, because Vercel builds every branch/PR with `NODE_ENV=production`. Production origins now include the apex, `https://www.crumbify.co.uk`, and - only when `VERCEL_ENV === 'preview'` and `VERCEL_URL` is set - the exact `https://${VERCEL_URL}` host. Still exact-match only, no wildcard or suffix matching. Guard: new tests cover the www apex, a lookalike suffix rejection, the exact preview host, a non-matching preview host, `VERCEL_ENV` not literally `"preview"`, and a missing `VERCEL_URL`.

Automation-as-infrastructure answer for this round: every finding above shipped with either a stronger existing guard (the anon/service-role split, the logging contract, the compensating-unban ordering, the ISO cursor regex) or a new class guard (`checkServerActionsGating`'s first-statement-order check for every future `'use server'` actions file). None of the nine findings were fixed without a guard.

Gates run this round: `npx jest --maxWorkers=2` -> 33 suites / 468 tests passed. `npx tsc --noEmit` -> only the seven pre-existing `stripe-webhook-refund.test.ts` tuple-index errors, unchanged. `npx eslint` on every changed file -> clean. `npx next build` -> compiled and typechecked successfully (only pre-existing, unrelated `themeColor`/`middleware` warnings).

## B6c review-to-zero fix round 3 (PR #21, third pass) - 2026-09-14

Codex (luna/sol) was over its usage limit for this round (companion status showed "You've hit your usage limit... try again at 10:19 PM"), so per the owner's hard rule (Codex unavailable for any reason -> Claude writes/reviews immediately, never idle) this round was authored and self-reviewed directly, with every guard change verified against the guard-defect-taxonomy's mutation-testing discipline rather than trusted on read. Lane logged here for the return-to-Codex trail.

Three findings, all fixed on `codex/admin-moderation`.

- **[HIGH] `admin-routes-gated.test.ts`'s `checkServerActionsGating` was kind-1 vacuous for a whole shape class, and kind-2 (checked the call, not the data flow), on the same guard the previous round had just added.** `export const NAME = async (formData: FormData) => {...}` (the standard Next.js const-arrow server-action shape) was never extracted at all - `extractExportedAsyncFunctions` only matched `export async function`, so a file using only the arrow form passed with zero functions checked. Separately, the guard pinned that `requireAdmin()` was CALLED first, not that its result was CHECKED: `const userId = await requireAdmin(); await doDangerousThing(...)` and a bare `await requireAdmin();` both passed, because `requireAdmin()` returns `string | null` and never throws (`src/lib/admin/auth.ts:62-66`) - the branch on the result IS the gate, and nothing pinned it existed or checked the right variable.
  - Rewrote extraction to cover `export async function NAME(...)`, `export const NAME = async (...) => {...}`, and `export const NAME = async function (...) {...}`, via brace/paren-depth scanning (`findParamListEnd`, `findBodyBraceIndex`, `findMatchingBrace`) rather than a single-line header regex, so a generic return type (`Promise<{ ok: boolean }>`) does not stop the header scan at the type literal's own brace.
  - A `'use server'` file from which zero exported async functions (of any of the three shapes) can be extracted now fails LOUDLY with its own distinct message ("no exported server actions could be parsed...") instead of passing vacuously - RED fixture: `export const SOME_CONSTANT = 42;` with no function export at all.
  - Rewrote the per-function check (`checkFunctionGating`) to pin the DATA FLOW, not the call: the first statement must be `const/let IDENT = await requireAdmin();`, and the second statement must be `if (!IDENT) <return|redirect>...` on the SAME identifier. Three distinct RED mutants, three distinct messages: result assigned but never checked ("does not immediately branch on 'X' being falsy"); result discarded via a bare `await requireAdmin();` ("discards the result instead of assigning it to a variable"); branch present but on a DIFFERENT identifier ("checks 'Y' in its second statement instead of 'X'").
  - Statements are reconstructed via a depth-aware scan of the whole body (splitting on top-level `;` and on the closing `}` of a brace block), with block and line comments stripped first and internal whitespace collapsed - so a body-leading `/** ... */` comment, a call reflowed across two lines, and a generic return type are all still GREEN on the real compliant shape. Each of those three additions ships its own mutation-pair RED test (`mutation pairs: the [A4] false-alarm fixes must not have made the guard vacuous...`) proving the fix did not also make the guard permissive for that shape.
  - Import provenance is now checked on the actions.ts path (it previously was not, even though the page/route path already required `from '.../lib/admin/auth'`): `requireAdmin` must be imported from the real auth module, and a local redeclaration (`const requireAdmin = ...`) is rejected outright, with two distinct RED messages ("is not imported from '@/lib/admin/auth'" vs. "is redeclared locally").
  - `[A5]` a dedicated test (`every failure mode has its own distinct message`) collects a failure message from all eight RED fixture families above and asserts `Set` size equals array length - no two failure modes share exact wording.
  - Both real files still pass unchanged: `admin/moderation/actions.ts` and `admin/referrals/actions.ts` both already used the `const X = await requireAdmin(); if (!X) return/redirect ...;` shape (referrals uses a bare `redirect(...)` with no `return`, which the guard also accepts since `redirect()` throws). Neither needed a code change; only the guard was strengthened.
  - `src/__tests__/lib/admin/admin-routes-gated.test.ts`: 77 lines removed, 695 added (`git diff --numstat`), all inside this one file - it is both the guard and its own test suite, per this repo's readFileSync+regex static-analysis pattern.

- **[MED] `ModerationUnbanPartialError` collapsed two different operator stories onto one redirect code.** The compensating re-ban (`unbanModerationUser`, `moderation.ts`) is only best-effort: if it ALSO fails or throws, the account is left genuinely unbanned with zero audit row, but the thrown error and the `unban_partial` redirect/copy said "the user was re-banned" regardless of whether the re-ban actually succeeded.
  - `ModerationUnbanPartialError` now carries a `restored: boolean` field recording the compensation's actual outcome, set inside `unbanModerationUser` from whether the re-ban's `updateUserById` call both resolved without an error AND did not throw.
  - `actions.ts`'s `unbanUserAction` redirects with `unban_partial` when `restored` is `true` and a new, distinct `unban_unprotected` when it is `false`.
  - `page.tsx` renders distinct copy for each: `unban_partial` keeps the existing "the user was re-banned... retry" copy; `unban_unprotected` states plainly that the account is NOT currently banned and no audit entry exists, and to retry immediately.
  - Tests: `moderation.test.ts`'s three existing compensation tests now assert `.restored` explicitly (`true` on a successful re-ban, `false` on a re-ban that returns an error, `false` on a re-ban that rejects) via a new `catchError` helper (awaits once, returns the rejection value, and itself throws if the promise unexpectedly resolves - so a broken assertion cannot silently read `undefined.restored`). `admin-moderation-actions.test.ts` adds a third redirect-code test for `restored: false` alongside the existing `restored: true` case, each asserting the OTHER two codes were never used. `admin-moderation-page.test.tsx` adds the `unban_unprotected` row to the existing message table plus a dedicated test asserting the two messages are textually different strings and only the unprotected one matches `/NOT currently banned/`.

- **[LOW] `resolveReportStatusFilter` passed an unvalidated `status` straight through as `p_status`.** `ModerationQueryOptions.status` is typed `ReportStatusFilter`, but that is only enforced at the current call site (`page.tsx`, which already validates via `isReportStatusFilter`) - a future caller with no such guarantee has no runtime guard between it and the `admin_list_reports` RPC.
  - `resolveReportStatusFilter` now takes `unknown` and re-validates via the existing `isReportStatus` guard; anything that is not `undefined`, not `'all'`, and not a real `ReportStatus` degrades to the safe default (`'queued'`) rather than being forwarded.
  - Test: `moderation.test.ts` calls `fetchModerationData` with `status: 'bogus'` (cast through `unknown`) and asserts the RPC receives `p_status: 'queued'` - this test fails against the pre-fix code (it would have asserted `p_status: 'bogus'` reached the RPC).

Automation-as-infrastructure answer for this round: the HIGH finding's automation is the rewritten guard itself, now proven against eight distinct RED fixtures plus three mutation-pair fixtures rather than the single before/after pair the previous round shipped with - the recurring class ("a data-flow-blind or shape-blind static guard") is what this round's whole taxonomy-driven rewrite targets. The MED finding's automation is the `restored` field plus its own distinct redirect code and copy, so a future reader of the error type cannot describe the wrong outcome to an operator. The LOW finding's automation is the boundary re-validation itself, matching every other input this module already double-checks in `data-state-services.md`'s "validate at every level" convention.

Gates run this round: `npx jest --maxWorkers=2` -> 33 suites / 486 tests passed (up from 468; +18 new tests, all in the seven files touched this round). `npx tsc --noEmit` -> only the seven pre-existing `stripe-webhook-refund.test.ts` tuple-index errors, unchanged. `npx eslint` on every changed file -> clean, zero output. `npx next build` -> compiled and typechecked successfully (only the same pre-existing, unrelated `themeColor`/`middleware` warnings as the prior round).

- Fix round 4 (Codex still over its usage limit, "try again at 10:19 PM", so authored directly by Claude per the owner hard rule): fixed four round-3 verify findings entirely inside `admin-routes-gated.test.ts` (comment/string-literal-blind provenance checks in both directions, the [A5] distinctness check comparing whole messages instead of reasons, an overly narrow falsy-branch form rejecting `=== null`/`== null`/`null === X`/`=== undefined`, and an export shape none of the three header regexes recognise being silently skipped when another export in the file parsed), each with RED/GREEN fixtures in both directions and a distinct reason - `npx jest --maxWorkers=2` -> 33 suites / 504 tests passed (up from 486); `npx tsc --noEmit` -> only the seven pre-existing `stripe-webhook-refund.test.ts` errors, unchanged.

## #819 moderation cursor tie-break 2026-09-18 (Codex luna)

- The moderation cursor is now a pair of the oldest row's exact `created_at` string and its `id`. The older link carries `before` and `beforeId`, and the composite values are sent as `p_before` and `p_before_id`.
- Invalid, incomplete, or mismatched cursor pairs are discarded together and the page loads page 1. Timestamp-only fallback can skip reports tied at the boundary, so returning to page 1 is the only option that cannot skip a report.
- Cursor validation accepts PostgREST timestamps with microsecond precision and numeric offsets, including `2026-09-13T12:00:00.123456+00:00`. The link builder uses `URLSearchParams`, preserving the plus as `%2B`; the RPC receives the parsed string byte-for-byte without a `Date` round trip.
- Page 1 deliberately sends exactly `p_status`, `p_limit`, and `p_before: null`, with no `p_before_id` key. The database migration must be applied before deploying this website change for paging past page 1. If the migration is rolled back after the website deploy, page 1 remains compatible because it still uses today's three-argument call.
- The tie-break regression uses a five-row in-memory RPC fixture with a two-row injected page size. Walking the real service through the real link builder reaches all five rows once; the timestamp-only control loses the tied row.

## #819 fix round 1 2026-09-19 (Claude sonnet, Codex quota lane)

Context an opus review established, executed against real database timestamp shapes: the previous cursor regex required exactly three fraction digits and a literal `Z`. PostgREST renders `+00:00` (never `Z`) and trims trailing zeros from the fraction, omitting it entirely for a zero fraction, so no real `created_at` from this database ever matched that regex. That means the moderation queue has never shown an "Older reports" link in production, on any page, since the pairing was introduced, because `isModerationCursor` rejected every real value before the pairing logic ever saw it. With at most 50 reports per page and a queue that has stayed small, this was invisible: nobody had reached a genuinely full page whose absence of a link would have looked wrong rather than merely quiet.

Six adjudicated findings, all FIX:

1. (HIGH) Rewrote `ISO_8601_INSTANT_RE` in `src/lib/admin/moderation.ts` to `/^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}T\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}(?:\.\d{1,6})?(?:Z|[+-]\d{2}:\d{2})$/`: fraction optional, 1 to 6 digits, `Z` or a numeric offset. Updated the comment above it to describe the real PostgREST rendering rather than `toISOString()`. Added an acceptance table in `moderation.test.ts` covering no-fraction with `Z` and with a numeric offset, one/two/three/five/six fraction digits, and a negative offset. Added a page-level test in `admin-moderation-page.test.tsx` that builds a full 50-row page whose last row carries one of three short-fraction shapes, asserts the rendered "Older reports" link forwards that exact string and the row's id, then re-renders the page with that link's search params and asserts `fetchModerationData` receives the identical string.
2. (MED) Moved `"2026-09-13T12:00:00Z"` out of the rejection list (it is now a real accepted shape, no-fraction with `Z`) and into the new acceptance table. The rejection list still covers: date-only, space instead of `T`, missing offset entirely, 7 fraction digits, a numeric offset with no colon, a garbage suffix, an impossible date the shape matches but `Date.parse` rejects, `not-a-date`, and an empty string.
3. (MED, blocked merge) Bounded the tie-walk test's `for (;;)` to `for (let page = 0; page < fixture.length + 2; page += 1)` and added an `exitedByIntendedCondition` flag set only at the two intended exits (empty/unavailable page, short page), asserted `true` after the loop. Mixed real timestamp shapes into the fixture (a no-fraction tied pair at `2026-09-13T12:00:00+00:00`, plus rows with `.5` and `.12` fraction shapes) and switched the fake RPC's ordering/filtering from string comparison to `Date.parse`-value comparison with an id fallback only for genuinely equal instants, per the review's note that mixed-format string comparison is unsound. Demonstrated the bound works by mutating the test's own loop body to skip the cursor-advance lines (simulating a cursor that stops surviving validation): the loop still terminated at the bound in about 4 seconds with `exitedByIntendedCondition` false, rather than hanging - this is the scenario that drove a worker to 3176 MB before this round. I also tried to demonstrate that the `Date.parse`-based comparison is necessary (versus plain string comparison) by reverting the fake RPC to string comparison; it stayed green, because my fixture's tied pair uses one exact repeated string and every other row is a distinct instant far enough apart that lexicographic and numeric order agree. Per the review's own instruction, a fixture with two DIFFERENT string spellings for the same instant should never be constructed (real Postgres cannot emit that for one column), so I could not produce a red demonstration for this specific sub-choice; the `Date.parse` comparison is kept as the defensively-correct form the review asked for, not as a claim that this fixture proves it necessary.
4. (MED) Replaced the hand-rolled "red control" test (its own array/filter/paging loop, touching no production export) with a test that drives the real `createModerationService` and the real `buildModerationHref`. Because item 5 below makes the service pair-or-nothing, a real client can no longer be made to page by timestamp alone, so the honest control is: an old client that calls the service with `{ before }` only (bypassing `buildModerationHref`, which refuses to emit an unpaired `before`) gets page 1 again on every attempt, never a skip-prone page. Asserted by id-set equality across three bounded attempts, plus a `toStrictEqual` pin on the last RPC call's params.
5. (MED) `fetchModerationData` in `src/lib/admin/moderation.ts`: replaced the reachable public-export bug (valid `before` with a missing/null `beforeId` fell through to timestamp-only paging) with pair-or-nothing: `paired = validBefore !== null && validBeforeId !== null`; `p_before: paired ? validBefore : null`; `p_before_id` set only when `paired`. Added an `it.each` at the service layer for (valid, missing), (valid, null), (valid, invalid), (invalid, valid), (missing, valid), each asserting the exact RPC params object via `toStrictEqual`.
6. (MED) Added direct `buildModerationHref` tests: an unpaired `before` alone, an unpaired `beforeId` alone, and a non-default status with a half cursor - each keeps only the status (or defaults) and drops the cursor entirely.

Also done (cheap items): pinned the page-1 RPC payload with `toStrictEqual` on `rpc.mock.calls[0][1]` (this and item 5's tests use `toStrictEqual` rather than `toHaveBeenCalledWith` specifically because `toHaveBeenCalledWith` treats an `undefined`-valued key as absent, which would hide a bug where `p_before_id` is set to `undefined` unconditionally). Added `normalizeReportPageSize`: an injected `reportPageSize` that is not an integer, or is less than 1, or is over 200, falls back to `REPORT_PAGE_SIZE`, since the database RPC clamps `p_limit` to 1..200 and the previous `?? REPORT_PAGE_SIZE` let a falsy-but-not-nullish `0` straight through.

Mutant table (test discarded and reverted by hand after each observation; `git status --short` confirmed the same five files throughout):

| Test(s) | Mutant | Failure observed |
|---|---|---|
| Acceptance table (item 1), page-level short-fraction test | Reverted `ISO_8601_INSTANT_RE` to the old `/^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}T\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}\.\d{3}Z$/` | 16 tests red; first at `moderation.test.ts:522` (`accepts exactly the ISO-8601 instant shape...`), plus all 8 new acceptance-table rows and 3 page-level rows; page test failed at `admin-moderation-page.test.tsx:302` (`getByRole('link', { name: 'Older reports' })` found no such link) |
| Item 5 `it.each` (valid/missing, valid/null), item 4 red control | Reverted `fetchModerationData`'s cursor logic to the pre-fix `hasBeforeId`/`else if` form | 3 tests red: `moderation.test.ts:185` (`toStrictEqual` expected `p_before: null`, received the timestamp), and the red control failed at `moderation.test.ts:756` (`toEqual` expected page 1's ids, received page 2's, i.e. a skip) |
| `buildModerationHref` item-6 tests | Relaxed `if (params.before && params.beforeId)` to `if (params.before)` | 2 tests red; `moderation.test.ts:587` (`toBe('/admin/moderation')`, received a URL carrying `before=...&beforeId=undefined`) |
| `reportPageSize` guard tests | Reverted `normalizeReportPageSize(...)` call to `options.reportPageSize ?? REPORT_PAGE_SIZE` | All 4 cases (zero, negative, non-integer, over 200) red; `moderation.test.ts:222` (`toHaveBeenCalledWith` expected `p_limit: 50`, RPC was never called with it - `p_limit: 0` etc. went through instead) |
| Page-1 `toStrictEqual` pin, item-5 `it.each`, red control | Changed `reportParams` to always set `p_before_id: paired ? validBeforeId : undefined` | 7 tests red; `moderation.test.ts:202` (`toStrictEqual` found an extra `p_before_id: undefined` key that `toHaveBeenCalledWith` would have hidden) |
| Tie-walk loop bound | Commented out the cursor-advance lines inside the test's own loop body (simulating a cursor that stops validating) | 1 test red in about 4 seconds at `moderation.test.ts:721` (`exitedByIntendedCondition` expected `true`, got `false`) - the bound converted a would-be hang into a fast, diagnosable failure |

Decision for item 4: the hand-rolled model was deleted. The replacement drives the real `createModerationService` and `buildModerationHref`. Since pair-or-nothing (item 5) means the real service can no longer be coaxed into timestamp-only paging by any valid input, the honest control is not "the service skips a report" but "an old client that withholds the id gets page 1 again, never advances" - proven by id-set equality across three bounded attempts and a `toStrictEqual` pin on the final RPC call.

Automation-as-infrastructure answer for this round: the HIGH finding's automation is the corrected regex itself plus an acceptance table pinned to the real PostgREST rendering rules (fraction optional, numeric offset, no `Z` requirement) rather than to `toISOString()`'s output shape, so a future change to the regex is checked against the actual database contract, not a JS convenience method. The loop-bound guard (item 3) is itself the automation for the "unbounded test loop" class the fix-plan flagged - the `exitedByIntendedCondition` flag makes a future regression fail fast instead of hanging a worker again. The pair-or-nothing fix (item 5) and its `toStrictEqual`-based tests are the automation for the "toHaveBeenCalledWith hides undefined keys" class documented in this repo's testing rules.

Verify (this round): `npx tsc --noEmit` -> clean, zero output. `npx eslint` on the four changed source/test files -> clean, zero output. `npx jest --testTimeout=20000 src/__tests__/lib/admin/moderation.test.ts src/__tests__/app/admin-moderation-page.test.tsx` -> 2 suites / 112 tests passed. Coverage on the two touched source files: `moderation.ts` 98.96% lines / 98.93% branches (up from 98.94 / 98.90); `page.tsx` 100% lines / 90.69% branches (unchanged) - neither regressed.

## #20 fix/20-founding-count-unavailable (2026-09-28, lane: Codex luna writer, opus reviewer)

Decisions:

- FoundingSection now starts with null data, renders no count or progress bar until a validated numeric count arrives, and retries non-OK, non-JSON, and missing-count responses three times with 1 second then 3 second backoff. An AbortController and active flag prevent state updates after unmount. After the final failure it keeps the CTA and renders the exact `.fremain` copy `Live count unavailable right now.`.
- The founding route destructures `error` and omits `count` when Supabase returns an error, null, non-finite, or non-numeric count. The webhook also destructures `error`; a count-read error logs, skips payment-link deactivation, and still returns `{ received: true }` to Stripe. The existing cap-read catch remains fail-safe in the same way.
- All Supabase count reads in `src/` now either destructure `count` and `error` directly or pass through the error-aware `readCount` helper. A static guard has offending and innocent fixtures plus a real-tree scan.
- `.fcount` now uses `var(--ink)`. A broad gold-text CSS guard was measured against the stylesheet and would flag many existing gold text selectors, including links, headings, metrics, and index labels, so no broad guard was shipped.

Deviations:

- `gh issue view 20` could not reach GitHub because the sandbox denied the network socket. The checked-out branch, local common brief, source, and tests were used as the available specification.
- The required coverage command passed all 38 suites and 608 tests but failed the existing global floor at 73.68% statements, 68.56% branches, 70.66% functions, and 75.17% lines. The full lint command reached four unrelated existing errors in `__mocks__/framer-motion.js`, `src/__tests__/middleware.test.ts`, and `src/components/legal/BackLink.tsx`, plus existing warnings. The build was blocked by offline Google Fonts fetches for four existing `next/font` imports. Changed-file TypeScript and lint checks were clean apart from one pre-existing warning in the touched webhook test.

Owner decisions still open: none.

What recurring class did this work expose, and what automation now guards it? Silent fallback of unavailable remote counts into plausible zero values. The component regression tests guard the user-visible loading, retry, unavailable, success, and unmount states. The route and webhook tests guard error-shaped Supabase responses, and the real-tree static guard prevents future count reads from omitting their error result.

## #20 fix/20-founding-count-unavailable (2026-09-28, lane: Codex luna writer, opus reviewer)

Decisions:

- Fixed the admin schema contradiction by using `profiles.onboarding_complete` for the onboarded metric. The owner must confirm that this boolean is the intended meaning of "onboarded" before deployment.
- Admin count reads now return `number | null` independently. One failed read is logged with metric, response status, and error code while the other seven metrics remain real. The admin page marks only the failed stat unavailable and logs a redacted source failure instead of silently discarding it.
- FoundingSection now gives each attempt its own 8 second AbortController timeout, keeps the unmount guard across retries and JSON parsing, and removes the dead retry-timer cleanup branch. The explanatory test header was restored with the new no-fabricated-count behavior.
- Waitlist, founding, and webhook count-read logs now use status and error code only. A waitlist rate-limit read failure is logged and continues to allow the signup. The webhook still returns `{ received: true }` and skips payment-link deactivation when its count is unknown, preserving its fail-safe behavior.
- Replaced the count-read regex guard with a TypeScript AST per-call guard. It detects option-key order independently, requires error checking before count use or a helper that throws, keeps calls independent inside `Promise.all`, uses identifier boundaries, and reports file:line locations. Fixtures cover M1-M4 as distinct red diagnostics, M6 as green, helper-throw handling, the cross-call case, and the real source tree.

Deviations:

- `gh issue view 20 --repo crumbdotco/Crumb-Website` was attempted from the worktree but the sandbox denied the GitHub network socket. The local common brief, checked-out source, existing tests, and reviewer findings were the available specification.
- `npm run test:coverage -- --runInBand --watchman=false` ran 40 suites and 627 tests successfully but exited non-zero because the existing global floor remained below threshold: 75.90% statements, 71.09% branches, 72.68% functions, and 76.86% lines. Changed source coverage was: FoundingSection 100 / 95.74 / 100 / 100; waitlist route 93.42 / 77.61 / 100 / 94.59; founding route 90.47 / 100 / 100 / 90.47; webhook 100 / 96.15 / 100 / 100; admin Supabase metrics 100 / 92.30 / 100 / 100, in statements / branches / functions / lines order. Admin page remains excluded by the repository coverage config.
- `npm run lint` completed with four pre-existing errors in `__mocks__/framer-motion.js`, `src/__tests__/middleware.test.ts`, and `src/components/legal/BackLink.tsx`, plus existing warnings. No new lint errors came from these changes. `npm run build` passed, with only existing middleware and metadata warnings.

Owner decisions still open: confirm that `profiles.onboarding_complete` is the intended onboarded definition in the live schema. No real Cloudflare, Vercel, Stripe, or Supabase network behavior was exercised in this sandbox.

What recurring class did this work expose, and what automation now guards it? Remote count reads can fail with an error object, a missing count, a rejected request, or a request that never settles, and each shape can otherwise become a plausible zero or an endless loading state. Component fake-timer tests guard retries, timeout, JSON validation, unmount aborts, unavailable copy, and CTA behavior. Route tests guard omission and fail-safe behavior. The AST guard now enforces checked error handling per count-read call across the real `src/` tree.

## Resume verification correction (2026-09-29)

- Re-ran `npm.cmd run test:coverage -- --runInBand --watchman=false`: 40 suites and 629 tests passed. The command exited non-zero only because the existing global thresholds remained below the configured floor: 76.09% statements, 71.46% branches, 72.68% functions, and 77.07% lines.
- Re-ran `npm.cmd run lint`: the same four pre-existing errors remain in `__mocks__/framer-motion.js`, `src/__tests__/middleware.test.ts`, and `src/components/legal/BackLink.tsx`; no changed-file errors were reported.
- Per the brief, `npm run build` was skipped because the sandbox cannot fetch Google Fonts; the orchestrator must run it in its networked environment.

### #20 fix round 2

Lane: Claude sonnet writer, opus reviewer.

- Count guard (`src/__tests__/security/supabase-count-error-guards.test.ts`): an error check now counts only if it sits in an `if` condition whose error branch returns or throws before `count` is used, or if every count use is confined to the success branch or the condition itself (the webhook's if/else shape). Polarity of a leading `!` is honoured. A ternary, a log-only branch, or any other read of `error` no longer counts. `count ?? <literal>` and `count || <literal>` on any count binding are banned outright, in the readCount helper too. Count reads are detected by ANY `count:` option value, and a same-scope const options object is followed. Property names such as `{ count: x }` and `a.error` are no longer counted as uses.
- Mutants A, B, C, D, E (plus F, G, H fallback and I wrong-polarity extras) are permanent red fixtures with distinct messages; eight innocent shapes prove no false alarm. M1-M4 keep their messages, M0 and M6 stay green, the real tree is green.
- Webhook (`src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`): the cap check moved into `checkFoundingCap()` with three stages. Count read throws log `{ stage: 'count_read', status: 0, code: 'FETCH_ERROR' }`; the cap read logs `{ stage: 'cap_read', code: 'CAP_UNAVAILABLE' }`; a failed `paymentLinks.update` logs `{ stage: 'payment_link_deactivate', code: 'STRIPE_UPDATE_FAILED' }` plus `stripeType` and `stripeCode` only when they are strings. Never a message or an email.
- Deviation (conservative): the count read destructures `{ count: rawCount, error, status }` so the guard can verify it; the non-throwing "count read failed" skip log keeps its previous wording.
- What recurring class did this expose, and what automation now guards it? An error check that does not stop the code path (log-only, ternary) plus a literal count fallback re-creates the "failed read looks like zero" bug. The AST guard now requires an exiting error branch and bans literal count fallbacks, with both-direction fixtures.

### #20 fix round 3

Lane: Claude sonnet writer, opus reviewer.

- Count guard (`src/__tests__/security/supabase-count-error-guards.test.ts`): an exiting error check now counts only if the `if` is a direct statement of a block (or module) that contains the first count use, in the SAME function body, and ends before that use (or the use sits in the if condition after `error ||`). A return or throw inside a nested block, callback, arrow function or never-called function no longer counts. A throwing-helper call counts only as a direct expression statement under the same rule. The if/else shapes (count confined to the success branch) stay accepted. New message: "count read error exit does not dominate count use".
- Options resolution now unwraps parentheses, `as X`, `<X>`, `satisfies X` and `!`, follows identifier hops through block and module scope, and follows object spreads (`{ ...base, head: true }`), so hoisted, wrapped and spread option objects are all seen as count reads.
- Fallbacks: any `??`, `||`, `??=` or `||=` whose left side is a count binding (through parentheses or casts) is banned, whatever the right side. The message is now "count must not fall back to another value".
- Fixtures: N3-N8, N10, N4, N5, N6, N16, `as const` (same and module scope), `satisfies` and a non-null wrapper are permanent red fixtures; five new innocent shapes stay green. Also proven red against scratch copies of the real founding route, admin helper and webhook (N1-N16 runner, all red except N9).
- Deviation (conservative approximation, no full control-flow analysis): dominance is "direct statement of an enclosing block, same function, before the use". A check inside a bare `{ }` block or a nested if is red even when it happens to dominate. The real tree stays green.
- Known gap left open: `Number(count)` coercion (N9) is still green; it was not in this round's rules.
- What recurring class did this expose, and what automation now guards it? An error check that does not dominate the count use (nested, callback, unreachable) and a wrapped or aliased fallback re-create "failed read looks like zero". The AST guard now requires a dominating exit and bans any count fallback, with red fixtures for each rule.

### #20 review close-out (round 5, orchestrator adjudication 2026-09-29)
- ACCEPTED-DEVIATION 1: `Number(count)`-style coercion (N9) is not caught statically; a guard cannot enumerate coercions. Check run (round 5 reviewer): the error path is blocked by the dominance rule in all four files; the null-count/no-error path has an outcome test for the founding route (waitlist-founding.test.ts:116-124), the webhook (stripe-webhook-extended.test.ts:520-532) and the admin helper (supabase-admin.test.ts:90-97).
- ACCEPTED-DEVIATION 2: the waitlist route's isDbRateLimited (src/app/api/waitlist/route.ts:54) has no null-count test. Check: that read fails open by design and a coerced 0 also means allow, so the user-visible outcome is identical; only the COUNT_UNAVAILABLE log line would be lost.
- ACCEPTED-DEVIATION 3: the dominance rule is stricter than real control flow (N15, and a use in the else branch of an exiting if). It fails closed and the real tree uses neither shape.
- Review rounds: 5 of 5 (cap). Lane: Codex luna writer (rounds 0-1), Claude sonnet writer (rounds 2-3), Claude opus reviewer.

## #18 fix/18-log-redaction (2026-09-29, lane: Claude sonnet writer, opus reviewer)

- Decisions: added `src/lib/redact-log.ts` (`redactForLog(value: unknown): string`), ported from the app repo's `supabase/functions/_shared/redact.ts`. It stringifies (Error as `Name: message`, objects as JSON, String() fallback, `[unloggable]` last resort), strips email shapes including URL-encoded `%40` and JSON `@`, strips credential params (key, apikey, api_key, access_token, refresh_token, id_token, token, secret, password, code, sig, signature), redacts BEFORE truncating, and bounds output to 500 characters plus a truncation marker.
- Decisions: every console call in non-test source that carried an error now goes through the helper. Supabase error objects log `redactForLog(error.message)` so existing exact-string assertions stay valid; caught values log `redactForLog(err)`, which adds the error name prefix and stringifies non-Errors (four existing test expectations updated accordingly). `getFoundingCap` also redacts the messages of the errors it throws, since callers log them.
- Decisions: the guard (`src/__tests__/security/log-redaction-guard.test.ts`) is TypeScript-AST based (comments never count). It flags caught variables, error-named identifiers or properties, and `.message/.details/.hint/.stack/.cause` reads, through templates, spreads, object literals, conditionals, binary expressions, casts and non-helper calls. `redactForLog(...)` arguments are not inspected further.
- Deviations: three sites are in a ratchet allowlist because unmerged branch fix/20-founding-count-unavailable rewrites them (webhook "Founding cap check failed:", founding route "waitlist count read failed:" and "cap unavailable:"). Reason on each: rewritten by #20 (Crumb-Website PR pending); remove when #20 merges. A stale entry FAILS the suite, so #20's merge forces the cleanup. Regions #20 rewrote were not edited.
- Deviations: the allowlist key is file plus first string literal of the call (line numbers rot). A call with no string literal keys as an empty string.
- Deviations: `founding-cap.ts` line 44 (the pre-existing `String(value)` fallback in `describeUnusableValue`) is not covered; the line was not changed here.
- Owner decisions still open: none. Repo-wide coverage remains below the global floor (pre-existing).
- What recurring class did this work expose, and what automation now guards it? Raw error values and Supabase `.message` strings reaching Vercel logs, where email-keyed tables echo the address. Guarded by `redactForLog` plus the AST guard above (fails on any unwrapped error-carrying console argument in src/, with both-direction fixtures and the stale-allowlist ratchet), and by route regression tests asserting the redacted DATA that was logged.

### #18 fix round 1

- Decisions (guard): the detector now taints names per function scope to a fixpoint: every name bound by a catch clause (including destructured), parameters of `.catch(cb)` and `.then(_, cb)` callbacks, locals and assignment targets whose initializer would be flagged (`const message = err.message` is the pre-fix waitlist line, now a permanent red fixture, both in full and verbatim), destructured names whose property is error-named, and same-file function parameters that a call site feeds a flagged argument (a forwarding helper is flagged at its own console call). A call to a same-file function is flagged only when one of its return expressions is (this keeps `describeServerError` in moderation.ts green: it returns only code and status).
- Decisions (guard): console is recognised through `console["x"]`, `globalThis/window/self/global.console`, aliases (`const log = console.error`, `.bind(console)`, `const c = console`, `const { error: w } = console`) and `.call`/`.apply`. `x["message"]`, `satisfies`, `<Error>x`, `new X(String(err))` and tagged templates are walked. `redactForLog` only counts when imported from a `redact-log` module and not redeclared anywhere in the file (file-wide, conservative: a redeclaration disables the helper for the whole file). Fixtures now carry the import.
- Decisions (redaction): the email scan is linear. An unquoted match is anchored by a lookbehind on the local-part character class, and a quoted local part is bounded to 64 characters. The raw input is capped at `MAX_INPUT_LENGTH` (8 x 500) before any regex runs; a capped input also drops its trailing non-space run, at most 254 characters (the isValidEmail limit), so an email cut by the cap cannot leak a fragment, while one unbroken run still logs. Timings for 50k-character adversarial inputs (no-@ run, run ending in @, dotted, domain-like tail, percent runs, quote run, unicode run): 1 to 5 ms each; the test bound is 100 ms.
- Decisions (redaction): the local part accepts `\p{L}\p{N}` plus `._%+!#$*'^` backtick `{|}~-`; domains accept `\p{L}\p{N}.-` with a `\p{L}{2,}` TLD (u flag). Quoted local parts (`"bob"@gmail.com`) are redacted. `= & ? /` are deliberately NOT local-part characters so `email=a@b.io&x=1` keeps its `email=` and `&x=1` context; the cost is that an address written `a&b@x.com` leaks the `a&` prefix. Logged trade-off.
- Decisions (LOW): the "json escaped" case was vacuous (an `@` in TypeScript source is a plain `@`). The regex now handles the literal six-character sequence backslash-u-0040 that JSON text carries, with a String.raw test.
- Deviations: none. Reviewer probes `supaDataErr` (a bare `res` logged), `error.error_description`, `error.body` and an IIFE that returns the error stay green: not in the finding's list, and flagging every `res` or every `.body` read would make the guard a false alarm on correct code.
- Recorded, not code: (1) the allowlist matches file plus first string literal, not a count, so a second console call with the same literal in an allowlisted file rides along (harmless until #20 merges and the entries go). (2) Out of scope for redactForLog: Bearer tokens, JWTs, a JSON `"password":"..."` value, camelCase token parameters (`accessToken=`), double-encoded `%2540`, and HTML entity `&#64;`. (3) `code=23505` (a Postgres error code) becomes `code=[redacted]` because `code` is a credential parameter name; accepted, the message text still identifies the failure. (4) `.catch(namedFn)` with an identifier callback is not tracked.
- What recurring class did this work expose, and what automation now guards it? Guards that pin one syntactic shape are bypassed by a rename, an alias or a local copy. The guard now follows data flow (tainted locals, aliases, forwarding helpers) and is pinned by both-direction fixtures including the permanent pre-fix waitlist line; the reviewer mutants that motivated it are fixtures, and the email scan has a timing test so a quadratic regex goes red.

### #18 fix round 2

- Decisions (redaction): the unquoted local run in `EMAIL_RE` is now `*`, not `+`, and `\p{M}` joined the local class. An address whose local part ends in a character outside the class (`alice&@`, `alice=@`, `alice?@`, `alice/@`, `alice)@`, `alice,@`, an emoji before the `@`) used to leak WHOLE, domain included; now the domain is always redacted and at most the prefix before the odd character survives (`alice&[redacted-email]`, the already accepted trade-off). NFD text (`jose` plus U+0301) is one local run again. The lookbehind still anchors the run, so the scan stays linear. A bare `@gmail.com` is now redacted too (a handle with a real domain is treated as an address).
- Decisions (test): the JSON-escape test used a plain `@` in its String.raw input and pinned nothing. It now carries the real six characters backslash-u-0040. Mutant seen red: removing the `|\u0040` alternative leaves `user@example.com` unredacted (scratch transpiled copy, not the tree). Other mutants seen red on the new tests: `*` back to `+` (alice&@gmail.com leaks whole), `\p{M}` removed (`jos` plus the mark leaks the `jose` fragment before the redaction).
- Decisions (test, correction to round 1): the round-1 claim that the 50k timing tests pin the lookbehind was wrong; the 4000-character input cap bounds `redactForLog` cost either way. Five new tests now run `EMAIL_RE` (exported for this) directly on UNCAPPED 50k-character inputs (no-@ run, run ending in @, dotted, percent, unicode) with a 100 ms bound. Measured 4 to 8 ms with the lookbehind on three runs; without the lookbehind a 30k run takes about 4100 ms, so removing it goes red (50k is roughly 11 s, so the mutant fails clearly instead of hanging).
- Decisions (guard): `for (const k of [err.message])`, `for (const k of taintedLocal)`, `for (const k in err)` and `for (k of [...])` into an existing variable now taint the loop variable (`taintLoopVariable`). Four red fixtures plus a clean-array green fixture. Mutant seen red: disabling the new branch fails all four red fixtures (4 failed, 82 passed).
- Deviations: none.
- What recurring class did this work expose, and what automation now guards it? Two: (1) a regex character class that silently excludes a delimiter-adjacent character turns a partial match into a whole miss; guarded by the per-character `it.each` leak tests, which assert the domain and full address are absent. (2) A taint tracker that follows declarations and assignments but not iteration bindings; guarded by the for-of and for-in fixtures. Timing claims now have a test that fails without the property they name.


### #18 fix round 3

- Decisions (guard): the callback parameters of array-iteration methods now inherit taint from a tainted receiver (`taintIterationCallback`). Methods: forEach, map, filter, some, every, find, findLast, flatMap (first parameter, the item) and reduce, reduceRight (accumulator and item). The index parameter is not tainted. The receiver is judged by the existing rules (array literal holding a tainted element, tainted identifier, chained call on one). Red fixtures: forEach, map, and reduce item over `[err.message]`. Green fixture: forEach over a clean array. Mutant seen red: removing the call to `taintIterationCallback` in a scratch copy fails all three red fixtures (3 failed, 87 passed); the tree is unchanged by the probe. Real-tree scan stays green.
- Correction to round 2: the round-2 class claim ("a taint tracker that follows declarations and assignments but not iteration bindings") was overstated. Round 2 covered for-of and for-in only, and array-callback iteration still escaped. Both iteration forms are now covered. Known remaining gap: callbacks passed by name (`arr.forEach(namedFn)`) and other higher-order receivers (Map.forEach, Object.entries chains beyond taint through the call) are not tracked beyond what receiver inspection gives.
- Deviations: none.
- What recurring class did this work expose, and what automation now guards it? Taint tracking that misses a binding form (iteration bindings, in two syntaxes). Guarded by the for-of, for-in and array-callback red fixtures, each seen red against a disabled-branch mutant.

### #18 review close-out (round 4, orchestrator adjudication 2026-09-29)
- ACCEPTED-DEVIATION 1: callbacks passed by name (`arr.forEach(namedFn)`) are not tracked (recorded in round 3).
- ACCEPTED-DEVIATION 2: a reduce/reduceRight accumulator seeded by a tainted initial value (`[1].reduce((a) => console.error(a), err.message)`) is not tainted; only a tainted receiver taints the callback parameters. Check: the round-4 reviewer confirmed a logged reduce RESULT is still caught by the call-argument rule, and no real log site uses this shape. The round-2/3 class claim is qualified accordingly: iteration bindings are followed for for-of, for-in and array-callback methods over a tainted receiver.
- ACCEPTED-DEVIATION 3 (from round 1): supaDataErr, error.error_description, error.body and an IIFE returning the error stay green (flagging them would false-alarm on correct code).
- Not filed: `console.error(x, err.errors)` is green because only specific property names are flagged (existing design).
- Review rounds: 4 of 5. Lane: Claude sonnet writer, Claude opus reviewer.

## #1213 fix/1213-assetlinks-eas-fingerprint (2026-10-23, lane: haiku writer, sonnet reviewer)

- Decisions: `public/.well-known/assetlinks.json` lists the EAS Android upload keystore fingerprint of `com.crumbify.app` (`FC:DF:19:...:F1`, 32 bytes, read from EAS credentials by the orchestrator). The Play App Signing key goes in later as a second entry; no value is invented. `relation` and `package_name` are unchanged.
- Decisions (content type): `next.config.ts` already sets `Content-Type: application/json` for `/.well-known/assetlinks.json` (with a `Cache-Control` of one hour). No change was made.
- Decisions (guard): `src/__tests__/well-known/assetlinks-json-shape.test.ts` runs a pure validator over the real file. It returns one distinct message each for: not JSON, not a non-empty statement array, wrong `package_name`, `relation` without `delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls`, empty fingerprint list, and any fingerprint that is not 32 uppercase hex bytes with colons. RED fixtures: the exact pre-fix placeholder file, plus unparseable JSON, empty array, non-object statement, wrong package, wrong relation, empty list, lowercase, 31 bytes, no colons, non-string entry. GREEN fixture: a valid file with a second fingerprint.
- Deviations: none. The pre-existing lint errors (`__mocks__/framer-motion.js`, `src/components/legal/BackLink.tsx`) are outside this branch and were not touched.
- Open: store installs are signed with the Play App Signing key, so App Links verify for Play installs only after the second entry lands (owner action, recorded in `public/.well-known/README.md`).
- What recurring class did this work expose, and what automation now guards it? Placeholder config shipped to production (a literal `REPLACE_...` value passed every gate and failed silently at runtime). Guarded by the shape guard, which reads the real file and goes red on the placeholder, an empty list, a malformed fingerprint, or a wrong package or relation.

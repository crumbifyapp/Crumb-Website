        <h2 style={headingStyle}>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p style={{ ...bodyStyle, marginBottom: 8 }}>When you use Crumbify, we may collect:</p>
        <ul style={listStyle}>
          <li>
            <span style={strongStyle}>Account information:</span>{" "}
            Name, email address, and username when you create an account via
            Apple Sign In, Google Sign In, or email OTP, plus a profile photo if
            you choose to upload one. Signing in
            with Apple or Google shares your name and email address with us so we
            can create your account; it does not give us access to anything else
            in your Apple or Google account.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style={strongStyle}>Date of birth:</span>{" "}
            Your month and year of birth, collected at sign-up to confirm you are
            old enough to use Crumbify and to set private defaults for under 18s.
            Other users cannot see it: it is never shown on your profile or shared
            with other users or advertisers. If your account was created before
            we started asking, we did not ask you; we recorded January 2000 as a
            placeholder, and you can contact us to correct it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style={strongStyle}>Restaurants you add:</span>{" "}
            When you share a TikTok or Instagram post into Crumbify, paste in a
            Google Maps list link, or search and add a place manually, we resolve
            the shared link to a restaurant and store that restaurant, your
            Visited and Saved status, and any score or note you attach. For a
            TikTok share, we read the caption via TikTok&apos;s public oEmbed
            service, and TikTok photo posts may be fetched from TikTok&apos;s embed
            pages; if a caption does not identify a place, the post&apos;s images
            are run through Google Vision text detection instead. For an Instagram
            share, the caption is extracted by our processor, Supadata. We store
            only the source (TikTok, Instagram, or Google Maps), the link you
            shared, the resolved restaurant, and the import status; we never store
            the caption text or the text read from an image. Crumbify does not
            connect to delivery-platform accounts or APIs, and it does not read
            your order history from screenshots.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style={strongStyle}>Reviews and private notes:</span>{" "}
            Scores out of 10 and personal notes you write about places you have
            been to.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style={strongStyle}>Profile photo:</span>{" "}
            If you upload an avatar, it is resized and re-encoded before upload
            and normally scanned by Google Vision SafeSearch to detect
            inappropriate content before being stored (see Content Moderation
            below).
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style={strongStyle}>Posts and photos:</span>{" "}
            When you post about a place to your profile wall or the Home feed,
            with an optional photo, we store it and normally run automated safety
            screening (Google Vision SafeSearch) before it is shown to others
            (see Content Moderation below). You
            can also choose, post by post, to share it to the public Trending
            tab as well.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style={strongStyle}>Social activity:</span>{" "}
            Reactions and comments on posts, friend connections and requests,
            groups you create or join and their shared lists, photos, comments,
            and reactions, and leaderboard participation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style={strongStyle}>Contacts you choose to match:</span>{" "}
            If you use the optional find-friends step, and only with your
            permission, we read the phone numbers and email addresses in your
            device contacts; we never read names or photos. Each value is
            converted to a one-way SHA-256 hash on your device before anything
            leaves it, and only those hashes (up to 2000 at a time) are sent to
            check for matching Crumbify accounts. The hashes from your contacts
            are used only for that check and are not stored; we keep only a
            record that a check happened (your account and the time) to limit
            how often it can run. Up to 200 matches are returned, and blocked
            users are excluded. So that other people can find you, a one-way
            hash of your own sign-up email is kept while your account exists.
            This step is optional and can be skipped.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style={strongStyle}>Location:</span>{" "}
            With your permission, we read your approximate device location in
            the foreground to power the Discover map and to search nearby places
            via Google Places. Your coordinates are sent to our servers only to
            run that search and are not stored there, and the last location fix
            is cached on your device for up to 7 days. Location permission is
            optional and is only ever requested once, during onboarding.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style={strongStyle}>Advertising identifiers:</span>{" "}
            We show ads via Google AdMob and, with your consent, use your device
            advertising identifier to personalise them. You can decline via the
            in-app consent prompt and, on iOS, the App Tracking Transparency prompt.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style={strongStyle}>Usage analytics:</span>{" "}
            Device and usage analytics about screens visited and features used in
            the App, collected via PostHog against a pseudonymous account ID
            only (no names, emails, or review content), and EU-hosted. The
            website separately collects anonymous performance metrics via
            Vercel Speed Insights.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style={strongStyle}>Push notifications:</span>{" "}
            If you enable notifications, we store a push token on your profile
            so we can deliver them. Notifications can include first-party
            content such as a friend&apos;s display name, a group name, or a
            place name. Turning notifications off removes the stored token.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style={strongStyle}>Founding-member checkout:</span>{" "}
            If you buy a founding-member place through the website, Stripe
            processes the payment and we store your email address to grant the
            tier to your account. We never see or store your card details.

          <li>We never access, store, or see your delivery-platform or other third-party account passwords.</li>
          <li>We do not connect to delivery-platform accounts or APIs, and we do not read order history from screenshots. Places are added by sharing a TikTok or Instagram post into the app, pasting a Google Maps list link, or manual search.</li>
          <li>We never upload your contacts&apos; names, photos, or readable phone numbers or email addresses; contact matching uses one-way hashes computed on your phone.</li>

          <li>We do not sell your data to advertisers or data brokers.</li>

        <p style={bodyStyle}>
          Cloud data is stored with our cloud database provider, using row-level
          security (RLS) policies that enforce per-user data isolation. All API
          communication uses HTTPS with TLS.
        </p>
        <ul style={listStyle}>
          <li>Auth tokens are stored on-device only using secure storage.</li>
          <li>Passwords are never stored - authentication uses Apple/Google Sign In or email OTP.</li>
          <li>
            Every photo you upload (avatars, post photos, group photos, review
            photos, collection covers) is resized and re-encoded before upload,
            which removes embedded photo metadata such as location tags.
          </li>
          <li>
            Avatars and feed-post photos are stored at public links, meaning
            anyone with the link can view the image. Group photos and private
            review photos are private and served through short-lived signed
            links. Collection covers are stored privately and shown according to
            the collection&apos;s visibility.
          </li>
          <li>Avatar and post-photo moderation logs are automatically deleted after 30 days.</li>

Sentry session replay records a masked visual replay of the screens, taps, and navigation in your session. It records every session in which an error occurs and one in ten other sessions. All text, images, and vector graphics are masked on your device before the recording leaves it, so the replay never contains what you typed or looked at. We use replays to reproduce crashes and bugs. Sentry is EU-hosted and keeps replays for 90 days, then deletes them.

          <li>If you are under 18, your profile starts as private. You can make it public in your privacy settings, and the app asks you to confirm first.</li>

      <section style={sectionStyle}>
        <h2 style={headingStyle}>8. Content Moderation</h2>
        <p style={bodyStyle}>
          We run automated SafeSearch screening (Google Vision) on uploaded
          avatars and post photos and reject images it flags as adult, violent,
          or racy. Automated screening is not perfect and may occasionally be
          unavailable, so you can also report any content or user in the app;
          reports are reviewed and actioned. Moderation logs are retained for 30
          days, then automatically deleted.
        </p>
        <p style={bodyStyle}>
          If we permanently ban an account for abuse, we keep one-way SHA-256 hashes of that account&apos;s email
          address and device identifier for as long as the ban stands, and a hash of the IP address used
          at the time of the ban for 30 days, so the same person cannot immediately re-register. The raw email address,
          device identifier and IP address are not stored for this purpose, and all of these hashes are deleted
          when a ban is lifted.

      </section>

      <section style={sectionStyle}>
        <h2 style={headingStyle}>9. Referral Link Tracking</h2>
        <p style={bodyStyle}>
          Some creators share tracking links in the form crumbify.co.uk/referral?code=CODE.
          When someone visits such a link, we record the referral code and the visitor&apos;s
          device platform (iOS, Android, or other), and store a salted SHA-256 hash of the
          visitor&apos;s IP address before redirecting them to the relevant app store. The raw
          IP address is never stored, only the hash, and only one record is kept per unique
          visitor per code. We use this solely to measure how many people a creator&apos;s link
          brings in, on the basis of our legitimate interest in measuring marketing
          effectiveness.

          Free-tier users see ads via Google AdMob: banners on the Home and
          Social tabs, native ads in the Discover scroll, and an occasional
          full-screen ad in the collections story viewer. We show the Google
          consent (UMP) prompt and, on iOS, the App Tracking Transparency
          prompt; ads are non-personalised unless you give both consents, and
          you can decline and still use the App. If you are under 18, or we do
          not yet know your age, ads are always non-personalised, and we tell Google AdMob to treat
          your ad requests as coming from someone under the age of consent. We
          never share your date of birth itself. Crumbify
          Premium removes all Google ads.

          Separately, clearly labelled &quot;Sponsored&quot; restaurant cards may appear
          in the App. These are not personalised; they are chosen by simple
          rotation from a campaign list rather than from your data, carry a
          gold &quot;Sponsored&quot; label, and involve no per-user tracking. They appear
          for everyone, about half as often for Crumbify Premium members.

        <p style={{ ...bodyStyle, marginBottom: 8 }}>
          We rely on different legal bases depending on the processing: your
          contract with us to provide the App, your consent for optional
          features such as contacts matching, location, and personalised ads,
          and our legitimate interests for security, moderation, and measuring
          marketing effectiveness. Under GDPR and UK data protection law, you
          have the right to:

        <ul style={listStyle}>
          <li>Access all data we hold about you.</li>

          <li>Object to processing of your data.</li>
          <li>Withdraw consent for optional data collection at any time.</li>
          <li>Request that we restrict processing of your data in certain circumstances.</li>

          Security, Tracking.

          Sentry and PostHog are EU-hosted. Some of the providers listed in
          section 6, including Google, RevenueCat, Expo, Stripe, Supadata, and
          TikTok, may process data outside the UK. Where that happens, we rely
          on UK data protection safeguards for the transfer, such as adequacy
          regulations or standard contractual clauses and the UK International
          Data Transfer Addendum.

          <li>Contact hashes sent during the find-friends check: not stored; only a record that a check happened (your account and the time) is kept, to limit how often it can run. A one-way hash of your own sign-up email is kept while your account exists so other people can find you.</li>

          <li>Pre-launch waitlist sign-up IP address and browser details: deleted 30 days after sign-up (the email itself is covered below).</li>
          <li>Trial-ending reminder scheduling records: 30 days.</li>
          <li>Founding-member emails: retained while the founding benefit exists, so the tier can unlock when you sign up with that email, or be restored by verifying it if you signed up with Apple&apos;s Hide My Email.</li>
          <li>Pre-launch waitlist emails: kept until you ask us to delete them; contact us any time to be removed.</li>
          <li>Referral-link records: kept as a salted IP hash (never reversible to an address) for up to 12 months from the click, then deleted.</li>

        <p style={bodyStyle}>
          Crumbify is for people aged 13 and over. We do not knowingly collect
          personal information from children under 13. If someone gives a
          month and year of birth that shows they are under 13, the App stops
          sign-up and deletes any account they have just created, with its data.
          If we learn that someone under 13 has created an account, we will
          delete the account and its data. Accounts
          for people aged 13 to 17 start as private, and we only use their date
          of birth to check their age and apply the under 18 protections
          described in this policy. If you are a parent or
          guardian and think your child under 13 has an account, contact us at
          support@crumbify.co.uk.

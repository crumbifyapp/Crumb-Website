        <h2 style={headingStyle}>2. Company Information</h2>
        <p style={bodyStyle}>
          Crumbify is operated by Crumbify LTD, a company registered in England and Wales
          under company number 17288992, with registered office at 60 Millmead Business
          Centre, Millmead Road, London, United Kingdom, N17 9QU. These terms are an

      <section style={sectionStyle}>
        <h2 style={headingStyle}>3. Description of Service</h2>
        <p style={bodyStyle}>
          Crumbify is a social food app built around a feed of the places your friends
          eat at. You add places by sharing a TikTok or Instagram post into the App,
          pasting in a Google Maps list link, or searching manually, then post about
          them, rate and note them, and save ones you want to try. Crumbify uses this
          to power a Home feed, an optional public Trending tab, a Discover map,
          reviews, want-to-try lists, groups, friends, profile collections, a profile
          wall with achievements, and a monthly Challenge. Crumbify does not connect
          to delivery-platform accounts via their APIs, and it does not read order
          history from screenshots.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section style={sectionStyle}>
        <h2 style={headingStyle}>4. Account Registration</h2>
        <ul style={listStyle}>
          <li>You must provide accurate and complete information when creating an account.</li>
          <li>You can sign up via Apple Sign In, Google Sign In, or email OTP (one-time passcode).</li>
          <li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account.</li>
          <li>You must be at least 13 years old to use the App. We ask for your month and year of birth when you sign up. If you are under 18, please make sure a parent or guardian is happy for you to use Crumbify.</li>

        <h2 style={headingStyle}>5. Accounts for Under 18s</h2>
        <p style={bodyStyle}>
          If your date of birth shows you are under 18, your account starts as private: only friends you accept can see your posts and reviews. You can change this in your privacy settings. If you make your account public, it works the same way as any other public account. You can still block or report anyone at any time.

        <h2 style={headingStyle}>6. Adding Places</h2>
        <p style={{ ...bodyStyle, marginBottom: 8 }}>

          from the recurring Crumbify Premium subscription available via the App Store
          and Google Play.

          <li>Founding Member access is digital content supplied immediately. By completing checkout you request immediate supply and acknowledge that you lose the 14-day cancellation right under the Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013 once access is granted; before access is granted you can cancel for a full refund by emailing support@crumbify.co.uk.</li>
          <li>Lifetime access lasts for as long as Crumbify operates the service. If we ever discontinue Crumbify we will give reasonable notice; individual Premium features may change or be replaced over time.</li>

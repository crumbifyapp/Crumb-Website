/**
 * src/app/post/[id]/page.tsx
 *
 * Pixel-fix F-53b (app repo, owner directive 2026-08-06, EXECUTION.md
 * wave-3 item 7b): marketing-site landing target for the post-share
 * universal link `https://crumbify.co.uk/post/<id>` (built by the app's
 * utils/post-share-link.ts's buildPostShareLink for a photo-bearing post,
 * shared from app/(tabs)/index.tsx's Home feed overflow Share/Copy Link
 * actions and app/review/[id].tsx's own Share action - buildPostShareLink is
 * photo-aware regardless of which route calls it). This page is what a
 * recipient WITHOUT the app installed sees - the app-side route
 * (app/post/[id].tsx in the app repo) handles the installed case via the
 * iOS `applinks:crumbify.co.uk` associated domain and the Android
 * `pathPrefix: "/post/"` intent filter (trailing slash - scoped exactly to
 * this path segment, mirroring /u/[username]/page.tsx's F53-R3 pattern).
 *
 * Server component: validates the id shape (a post UUID - the app repo's
 * services/social/post-detail.ts's UUID_RE) and renders the shared
 * AppShareLanding client island, mirroring /u/[username]/page.tsx's shape
 * exactly (this page never queries Supabase directly - only the installed
 * app resolves posts).

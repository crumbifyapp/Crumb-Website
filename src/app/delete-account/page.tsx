          Deletion cascades across our database, so removing your account removes the data
          tied to it. Photos you uploaded (avatars, feed post photos, collection covers, and
          group photos) are deleted from storage as part of the same flow. If you signed in
          with Apple, we also ask Apple to revoke the Sign in with Apple connection for
          Crumbify as part of deletion.

            If you had a premium subscription or founding status, we keep a minimal

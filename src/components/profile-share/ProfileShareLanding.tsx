/**
 * src/components/profile-share/ProfileShareLanding.tsx
 *
 * Pixel-fix F-53 (app repo, docs/v0.9.3/PIXEL-PASS-FINDINGS.md:1414-1442):
 * lands a "Share profile" universal link recipient who does NOT have the
 * app installed (or whose OS declined to auto-open it). A recipient who DOES
 * have the app - and where the OS's universal-link / App-Link verification
 * succeeded - never reaches this page at all; the OS opens the app directly
 * into app/u/[username].tsx (app repo).
 *
 * Custom-scheme second-chance attempt (`crumbify://u/<username>`), fix-round
 * r1 F53-R5: ANDROID ONLY does this automatically on mount - Android's
 * intent-based handoff for an unregistered scheme degrades gracefully
 * (Chrome either silently no-ops or shows a dismissible "open in app?"
 * chooser). iOS Safari and desktop browsers instead surface a BLOCKING
 * "cannot open the page / address is invalid" alert for an unregistered
 * custom scheme, which would hit exactly the audience this page exists to
 * convert - those platforms never attempt automatically; they get an
 * explicit "Open in the Crumbify app" button instead, gated behind a real
 * user gesture (also safe to offer on Android as a manual retry).
 *
 * Fix-round r2 (F53-N2): `isAndroid` is false on the server-rendered HTML
 * (there is no `navigator` during SSR - see getServerIsAndroidSnapshot
 * below), so before r2 an Android recipient's FIRST PAINT was the
 * give-up "get the app" fallback CTA, which then flipped to the "Opening
 * in the Crumbify app..." message once React hydrated and re-read the real
 * user agent - the opposite of the intended experience. r2 fixed this by
 * gating BOTH branches on `isHydrated` (also read via useSyncExternalStore),
 * so nobody sees the give-up state flash before the real handoff attempt
 * fires - but that made the SERVER-RENDERED HTML content-empty on every
 * platform (a no-JS visitor got only the "@username" heading - no store
 * badges, no explanation, no way forward at all).
 *
 * Fix-round r3 (F53-R3-3) removed the `isHydrated` gate from the
 * fallback-CTA branch only (see `showFallbackCta` below) and, in doing so,
 * DELIBERATELY REOPENED F53-N2 - this is an accepted trade, not an
 * oversight, made by the orchestrator on round-4 re-review
 * (wave1-rereview-r4-journal.jsonl, R4-WEB-2): a no-JS dead end (r2's
 * shape) is judged worse than a brief pre-hydration flash of the fallback
 * CTA on Android (r3's shape). Concretely, on a genuine Android device the
 * sequence is once again: the give-up fallback CTA (copy + "Open in the
 * Crumbify app" button + store badges) paints first, THEN hydration
 * confirms `isAndroid` and swaps to the "Opening in the Crumbify app..."
 * message - the same flash F53-N2 (r2) originally fixed and F53-R3-3 (r3)
 * reintroduced. iOS/desktop and no-JS visitors are strictly better off
 * (the fallback CTA - the correct FINAL state for them - is now in the
 * first paint instead of a blank page), which is why the trade was kept
 * rather than reverted. There is NO hydration-mismatch bug here (a
 * separate, narrower claim than "no flash"): `getServerIsHydratedSnapshot`/
 * `getServerIsAndroidSnapshot` both still return false during the actual
 * server render AND the client's hydration-matching render, so server
 * HTML === hydration HTML; the visible flash is an ordinary post-hydration
 * update once `useSyncExternalStore` re-reads the live snapshots, not a
 * mismatch. See implementation-notes.md "Round 4 re-review" for the full
 * F53-N2-vs-F53-R3-3 writeup.
 *
 * Brand rules (house, ~/.claude/rules/common/frontend-design.md +
 * this repo's CLAUDE.md): no money/£ figures, no letter-spacing > 0, no
 * em/en dashes (plain hyphens only), no decorative separator dots, no
 * spotlight/glow effects.

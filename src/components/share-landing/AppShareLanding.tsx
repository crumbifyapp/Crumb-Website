/**
 * src/components/share-landing/AppShareLanding.tsx
 *
 * Pixel-fix F-53b (owner directive 2026-08-06, EXECUTION.md wave-3 item 7b
 * "website-first share links EVERYWHERE, not just profile"): generic
 * landing target for a share-link recipient who does NOT have the app
 * installed (or whose OS declined to auto-open it), for every surface
 * BESIDES profile - review (/review/[id]), post (/post/[id]), place
 * (/place/[id]). A recipient who DOES have the app never reaches this page
 * at all; the OS opens the app directly via the matching app-side route (or,
 * for place, the app-side manual Linking listener - see the app repo's
 * services/deeplinks/link-builder.ts header for why place has no dedicated
 * expo-router file route).
 *
 * This is components/profile-share/ProfileShareLanding.tsx's shape made
 * generic (kicker/heading/description copy + the crumbify:// path segment +
 * id are all props) rather than three more hand-rolled near-copies of the
 * same SSR/hydration trade - see src/components/share-landing/
 * use-hydrated-platform.ts's file header for the full writeup of that trade
 * (F53-N2 vs F53-R3-3) and why every consumer of this component inherits it
 * unchanged. ProfileShareLanding.tsx itself is INTENTIONALLY NOT rebuilt on
 * top of this component - it already shipped, was reviewed across four
 * rounds, and carries its own established regression tests; only its
 * isAndroid/isHydrated plumbing was extracted to the shared hook (see that
 * component's own file header).
 *
 * Custom-scheme second-chance attempt (`crumbify://<pathSegment>/<id>`),
 * mirrors ProfileShareLanding's F53-R5 platform gate: ANDROID ONLY attempts
 * this automatically on mount (Android's intent-based handoff for an
 * unregistered scheme degrades gracefully); iOS Safari/desktop get an
 * explicit tap-gated "Open in the Crumbify app" button instead (a blocking
 * "cannot open the page" alert on those platforms would hit exactly the
 * audience this page exists to convert).
 *
 * Brand rules (house, ~/.claude/rules/common/frontend-design.md + this
 * repo's CLAUDE.md): no money/£ figures, no letter-spacing > 0, no em/en
 * dashes (plain hyphens only), no decorative separator dots, no
 * spotlight/glow effects.
